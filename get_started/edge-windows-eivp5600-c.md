# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect eIVP5600 device running Windows 10 IoT Enterprise with Azure IoT Edge Runtime pre-installed and Device Management. This multi-step process includes:

-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and Deploy client component to test device management capability

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-windows]
-   [Setup your IoT hub](https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0044p)
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   [Sign up to IOT Hub](https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0044p)
-   [Add the Edge Device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart)
-   [Add the Edge Modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart#deploy-a-module)
-   eIVP5600 device.

## 3.1 Edge RuntimeEnabled (Mandatory)

**Details of the requirement:**

The following components come pre-installed or at the point of distribution on the device to customer(s):

-   Azure IoT Edge Security Daemon
-   Daemon configuration file
-   Moby container management system
-   A version of `hsmlib` 

*Edge Runtime Enabled:*

Open the powershell on your IoT Edge device , confirm the status of the IoT Edge service.

    Get-Service iotedge

Examine service logs from the last 5 minutes. If you just finished installing the IoT Edge runtime, you may see a list of errors from the time between running **Deploy-IoTEdge** and **Initialize-IoTEdge**. These errors are expected, as the service is trying to start before being configured. 

    . {Invoke-WebRequest -useb aka.ms/iotedge-win} | Invoke-Expression; Get-IoTEdgeLog

List running modules. After a new installation, the only module you should see running is **edgeAgent**. After you [deploy IoT Edge modules](how-to-deploy-modules-portal.md), you will see others.
